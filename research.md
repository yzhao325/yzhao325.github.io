## Research

My research is instrumentation-focused, with a heavy learning towards early universe radio astronomy. Specifically, I look at neutral hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization. I work on a couple instrumentation projects in this field, including DORA and ECHO. I have also worked on optical instrumentation with the Terminal Tracking Cameras (TTCams) on the NASA Lucy mission.

## The Deployable Optical Receiver Array (DORA)

DORA is a joint venture between ASU's Interplanetary Lab and the LoCo Lab. The IPL was responsible for the design, build, and testing of the spacecraft, while the LoCo Lab built the guest payload, a low-frequency radio spectrum survey experiment. DORA's Radio Background Experiment aims to characterize the RFI environment in low-Earth orbit, as a pathfinder experiment for future 21-cm cosmology experiments. The existence of radio frequency interference (RFI), particularly human-made RFI such as FM radio, presents a challenge to radio astronomers aiming to observe the faint 21-cm hydrogen signal from the early universe. Current 21-cm experiments avoid RFI by building instruments in remote locations, while space-based 21-cm experiments have been proposed as alternative radio quiet locations.

## The External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories (ECHO)

One of the biggest limitations of instrument sensitivity in 21-cm cosmology is instrument systematics due to environmental factors.

## The Terminal Tracking Cameras (TTCams) on the Lucy Mission

The NASA Lucy Discovery mission, launched in October 2021, is the first mission to the Trojan asteroids, which are regarded as an opportunity to learn more about the history and formation of the solar system. The Terminal Tracking Cameras (TTCams) on the Lucy Mission are primarily a flight navigation tool, but have a secondary science objective to observe the Trojans asteroids at closest approach. As a result, radiometric calibration of these cameras
