I'm Yifan Zhao, an astronomer and an instrumentalist specializing in 21-cm cosmology. I also go by Amy. I received my B.S. in Physics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at Arizona State University.

## Teaching and outreach

The <b>LoCo Lab Radio Astronomy Bootcamp</b> is a summer week-long bootcamp run by the <a href="https://loco.lab.asu.edu/">Low-Frequency Cosmology (LoCo) Lab</a> at Arizona State University for undergraduate students interested in learning more about radio astronomy or in working for the LoCo Lab. I have helped to develop the teaching materials and led sessions at the 2023 version of this bootcamp.

The <b>Completely Hackable Amateur Radio Telescope (CHART)</b> is an outreach program developed in collaboration between Arizona State University and Winona State University that aims to teach high schoolers about DIY radio astronomy. I have mentored undergraduate students on the development and testing of this project. Read more <a href="https://astrochart.github.io/main_page">here</a>.

I've also TA'd for summer programs such as the <a href="https://summerscience.org/">Summer Science Program</a> and for undergraduate courses at ASU, including SES 410: Senior Exploration Project.
